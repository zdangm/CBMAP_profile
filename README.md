## CBMAP
The China Brain Multi-omics Atlas Project (CBMAP) aims to generate a comprehensive molecular reference map of over 1,000 human brains (Phase I), spanning a broad age range and multiple regions in China, to address the underrepresentation of East Asian populations in brain research. By integrating genome, epigenome, transcriptome, proteome (including multiple post-translational modifications), and metabolome data, CBMAP is set to provide a rich and invaluable resource for investigating the molecular underpinnings of aging-related brain phenotypes and neuropsychiatric disorders. Leveraging high-throughput omics data and advanced technologies, such as spatial transcriptomics, proteomics, and single-nucleus 3D chromatin structure analysis, this atlas will serve as a crucial resource for the brain science community, illuminating disease mechanisms and enhancing the utility of data from genome-wide association studies (GWAS). CBMAP is also poised to accelerate drug discovery and precision medicine for brain disorders.
